# advent_of_code_2023

This is my code for advent of code 2023.
It's quick and dirty code, unoptimized, slow, with no comments, no error handling, bad naming of both variables and functions  
Probably I reinvented the wheel countless times in this code but... who cares?  

When I wrote this, only God and I understood what I was doing  
Now, God only knows


# Instructions
Every script solves one puzzle and expects to receive the puzzle input via STDIN.  
The puzzle input must be provided exactly as provided by advent of code site: no additional leading/trailing spaces/newlines/carriage return/other stuff  
Every script outputs the solution and a trailing newline character.  
This is a command line example to solve a puzzle:  
cat 01-input.txt | go run 01-part1.go

Tested with golang version 1.21.4
